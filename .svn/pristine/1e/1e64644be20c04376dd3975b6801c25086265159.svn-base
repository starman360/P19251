Use this folder for your ready-for-publication documents.  Some templates are provided in this folder, and you should delete or rename these as appropriate for your own project:

* Conference paper (other templates may be useful if you are submitting your MSD work to an [https://www.asme.org/shop/proceedings/conference-publications/author-templates ASME] or [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html IEEE] conference)
* Poster
* Final presentation

You may also want to create subfolders here for your final design documents (for example, you may want to put final CAD, software, and instruction manuals here).  Remember to use filenames that will make sense for other people who may need to use your work after you finish!
