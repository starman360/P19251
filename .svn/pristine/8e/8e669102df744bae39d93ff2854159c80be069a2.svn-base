Your website should document your journey through MSD, so include work-in-progress as well as latest results.  Use pdf's for display whenever possible so that information is easily viewable without the need to download files and open applications.  (Your EDGE file repository should still contain original editable files).

'''All template text must be removed prior to your Final Demo and Handoff'''

==Team Vision for Final Demo and Handoff==
Summarize:
*What did your team plan to do during this phase?
*What did your team actually accomplish during this phase?

==Test Results Summary==

Summarize [[Problem Definition Documents/Requirements and Testing.xlsx | test results]] and assess effectiveness of test plans to unambiguously demonstrate satisfaction of the engineering requirements. Include photos and videos as appropriate

===Inputs & Source===
#Test Plan
#Results of system integration

===Outputs & Destination===
#Test Results
#Final documentation: paper, poster, manuals

==Risk and Problem Tracking==
* Update your [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Risk Management template.xlsx | Risk Management]]. At this point, your risks should all have been driven to 0.
* Update your [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Problem Tracking Template.xlsx | problem tracking]].

==Final Project Documentation==
*Include a link to your team's technical paper [[Final Documents/TechnicalPaperTemplate_single_column.docx | using the template here]].
*Include a link to your team's final poster [[Final Documents/Poster_template.pptx | using the template here]].
*Include links to final design documents as appropriate.  '''Copy and paste the work breakdown by topic table from your team's project home page and place it in this location''' to capture items such as:
**CAD/Schematics
**Final BOM
**Manufacturing and Assembly Instructions
**Operator Manual
**Service Manual
**Software
**Recommendations for future work

== Functional Demo Materials ==
Include links to:
* Pre-read
* Presentation and/or handouts
* Notes from review
* Action Items

==Plans for Wrap-up==
*As a team, what do you need to do to conclude your project? 

*As an individual on the team, what are you doing to help your team achieve these goals? (Use the [https://edge.rit.edu/edge/PTemplate/public/Project%20Management/planning/Three-Week%20Plan%20Template.docx  individual 3-week plan template] for this)
