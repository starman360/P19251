Your website should document your journey through MSD, so include work-in-progress as well as latest results.  Use pdf's for display whenever possible so that information is easily viewable without the need to download files and open applications.  (Your EDGE file repository should still contain original editable files).

'''All template text must be removed prior to your Build & Test Prep Review'''

==Team Vision for Build & Test Prep Phase==
Summarize:
*What did your team plan to do during this phase?
*What did your team actually accomplish during this phase?

==Test Plan Summary==

Use your [[Problem Definition Documents/Requirements and Testing.xlsx | test plan]] to summarize test results and assess effectiveness of test plans to unambiguously demonstrate satisfaction of the engineering requirements

===Instructions===
# Ensure test plans are in place
# Ensure that all applicable test standards have been cited (e.g., ASTM)
# Ensure all ordered materials have been received
# Ensure team has space and equipment necessary to begin building and testing

==Risk and Problem Tracking==
* Update your [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Risk Management template.xlsx | Risk Management]]
* If you have risks that have manifested themselves as problems, begin [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Problem Tracking Template.xlsx | problem tracking]].

== Design Review Materials ==
Include links to:
* Pre-read
* Presentation and/or handouts
* Notes from review
* Action Items

==Plans for next phase==
*As a team, where do you want to be in three weeks at your next review?
