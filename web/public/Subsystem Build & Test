Your website should document your journey through MSD, so include work-in-progress as well as latest results.  Use pdf's for display whenever possible so that information is easily viewable without the need to download files and open applications.  (Your EDGE file repository should still contain original editable files).

'''All template text must be removed prior to your Subsystem-Level Build & Test Review'''

==Team Vision for Subsystem Level Build & Test Phase==
Summarize:
*What did your team plan to do during this phase?
*What did your team actually accomplish during this phase?

==Test Results Summary==

Summarize [[Problem Definition Documents/Requirements and Testing.xlsx | test results]] and assess effectiveness of test plans to unambiguously demonstrate satisfaction of the engineering requirements

===Instructions===
# Quantitatively summarize the capabilities, performance, throughput, and robustness of your subsystems as demonstrated by execution of the text plan. Document your testing with photos or videos in addition to test data.
# Evaluate how well the test plan was able to confirm satisfaction of subsystem requirements
#Include snapshot of testing completed to date, and include link to live [[Problem Definition Documents/Requirements and Testing.xlsx |  requirements and testing document]]

===Inputs & Source===
#Test Plan
#Subsystem fabrication

===Outputs & Destination===
#Test Results
#System integration

==Risk and Problem Tracking==
* Update your [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Risk Management template.xlsx | Risk Management]]
* Update your [[Project Management/risk and problem management/Problem Tracking Template.xlsx | problem tracking]].

== Functional Demo Materials ==
Include links to:
* Pre-read
* Presentation and/or handouts
* Notes from review
* Action Items

==Plans for next phase==
*As a team, where do you want to be in three weeks at your next demo? 

*As an individual on the team, what are you doing to help your team achieve these goals? (Use the [https://edge.rit.edu/edge/PTemplate/public/Project%20Management/planning/Three-Week%20Plan%20Template.docx  individual 3-week plan template] for this)
