Use this folder to store your team's CAD files.  Consider including the following:

* A 3D pdf of your system or any critical components. This is a powerful way to share your 3D solid models with anyone, whether their computer supports your CAD software or not. An example is [https://edge.rit.edu/edge/P14031/public/CAD/Jib%20Transfer%20System%203D%20PDF.PDF here].  Any commercial CAD package should allow you to create a 3D pdf by...
**In Creo, Save As a PDF U3D (*.pdf)
**In SolidWorks, Save As a .pdf and select the resulting checkbox to create a 3D .pdf
* A single zipped file that contains your entire CAD package
* Individual part files in CAD software format
* A single file with all drawings in .pdf format
* Individual drawing files in .pdf format

If your team does not have CAD files, please delete this folder!
