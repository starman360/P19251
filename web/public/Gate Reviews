Your team will hold a gate review with your guide at the end of each semester.  This page should document any information needed for the review, as well as outcomes.  

==MSD I: Readiness to move to Build & Test==
* Use this space to organize information for your review.  Key elements are listed [[Project Management/MSD I Gate Review.docx | here]]
* Your team should complete a [[Project Management/MSD I Self-critique.xlsx | self-critique]] and report the results here.

===Expectations===
* All team members present and prepared to report on team and individual status.
* All team MSD deliverables are complete and uploaded, and ready to be graded.
* Guide is present and prepared to evaluate all items included in the review.
* Review should take about an hour.


===Status Review===
'''Current state of the project'''

* Summarize expected performance vs. requirements (include snapshot of current requirements document here, along with a link to the live document.)

* Address any issues raised during your Detailed Design Review. These will generally fall into one of three categories
** Issues that have been addressed and the team is closing them out. (GREEN, team is ready to proceed to build and test)
** Issues that have not been addressed yet, but the team has a clear path to a solution. (YELLOW, team expects to be ready for build and test, and a Critical Design Review may be held in MSD II Week 2)
** Issues where the team has not been able to identify a solution or a clear path to a solution.  (RED, team is not ready for build and test, and a Critical Design Review will be held in MSD II Week 2)

* Compare your current project plan/schedule to your original plan/schedule. 
** Has the scope of your project changed?  
** How and why did your schedule change? 
** What have you learned from these changes?

* Review individual team member status.
** Did you deliver on your personal responsibilities? 
** Did you use your MSD I plan effectively?  Was it realistic?  If not already addressed above, what did you learn from this and how have you applied this toward a meaningful and realistic MSD II plan?

*Compare your current risk assessment to your original.
** Have you closed out your most important risks?
** Do you have remediation plans for remaining risks?
** Have any of these risks manifested themselves as problems?
** How did your risk assessment change?  What can you learn from this?

'''Review your team's MSD II schedule (if not done during DDR)''' 
* Your schedule demonstrates that you can deliver a functional prototype to your customer by your final phase demo.
* Your schedule incorporates lessons learned from your MSD I reflection.
* Spring-finish teams should include a vision for their Imagine RIT exhibit.

'''Deliverables Checklist and Website Status'''
*All documents must be uploaded to your website in advance of the Gate Review.  
* The team should not use gate review time to conduct a detailed examination of specific deliverables unless related to discussion items in the status review.
